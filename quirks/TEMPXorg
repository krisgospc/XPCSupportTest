This folder is where S76 is putting their X.org configs for their
models with Nvidia cards.
The file I have changed to ospcsupport is the base file for
Nvidia based computers.

The ospcsupport-nvidia-quirks file is the base for Xorg for nvidia drivers
System 76 takes that and makes separate quirk files for each model that they have
with Nvida cards
